# Consolidation strategy

  phase_2: "Merge related functionality into primary implementations"
  phase_3: "Update build system to remove references to deleted files"

  phase_5: "Validate that all functionality is preserved"

# Impact analysis
impact_analysis:
  build_system_updates_required:
    - "CMakeLists.txt - Remove deleted file targets"
    - "Makefile - Update build rules"
    - "Test configurations - Update test file references"
    
  include_statement_updates:
    - "All files including removed headers need updates"
    - "Test files referencing removed test files need updates"
    - "Main.cpp needs refactoring to use proper CLI interface"
    
  functionality_preservation:
    - "All essential functionality must be preserved in consolidated files"
    - "Test coverage must be maintained"
    - "No regression in system capabilities"
