# Ruleset Migration Mapping Report
# Generated: 2025-07-08

## Executive Summary
Complete migration mapping documenting the successful transformation of Akao rulesets from language-based categorization to architecture-based governance organization, enabling systematic architectural governance and eliminating governance fragmentation.

## Migration Overview

### Transformation Summary
- **Original Organization**: Language-based categorization (structure/cpp_standards, etc.)
- **New Organization**: Architecture-based governance categories
- **Total Rules Migrated**: 14 rules successfully integrated
- **Architecture Categories Created**: 6 comprehensive governance domains
- **Governance Domains Established**: 7 specialized governance areas

## Detailed Migration Mapping

### 1. System Architecture Governance Migration
**Target Ruleset**: `akao:ruleset:architecture:system:structural_governance:v1`
**Governance Domain**: Structural integrity and component organization

| Original Rule | Original Category | Migration Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| structure:layout_enforcement | structure | Core architectural layout governance principle |
| structure:file_organization | structure | Foundation for system organization standards |
| structure:folder_validation | structure | Essential for structural integrity validation |
| structure:class_separation | structure | Critical for component governance and separation |

**Architectural Justification**: These rules form the foundation of system architectural integrity and must be governed as a unified structural governance domain rather than language-specific structures.

### 2. Quality Architecture Governance Migration
**Target Ruleset**: `akao:ruleset:architecture:quality:measurement_governance:v1`
**Governance Domain**: Quality measurement and performance standards

| Original Rule | Original Category | Migration Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| measurement:performance_monitoring | measurement | Core quality architecture performance governance |
| measurement:metrics_collection | measurement | Foundation for quality measurement standards |
| measurement:error_reporting | measurement | Essential for quality issue governance and traceability |
| measurement:violation_tracking | measurement | Critical for quality compliance and archaeological preservation |

**Architectural Justification**: Quality governance requires unified measurement standards across all architectural domains, not fragmented by implementation language.

### 3. Development Architecture Build Governance Migration
**Target Ruleset**: `akao:ruleset:architecture:development:build_governance:v1`
**Governance Domain**: Build process and environment management

| Original Rule | Original Category | Migration Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| build:environment_switching | build | Core to development architecture and runtime preparation |
| build:configuration_modes | build | Foundation for build duality philosophy implementation |

**Architectural Justification**: Build governance must support future Akao runtime architecture and maintain consistency across all development contexts.

### 4. Development Architecture Language Governance Migration
**Target Ruleset**: `akao:ruleset:architecture:development:language_governance:v1`
**Governance Domain**: Language isolation and scope separation

| Original Rule | Original Category | Migration Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| language:scope_separation | language | Essential for Pure Logic development and architectural clarity |
| language:single_primary_lang | language | Foundation for YAML independence and language isolation |

**Architectural Justification**: Language governance supports architectural evolution toward Pure Logic independence and systematic language management.

### 5. Interface Architecture Contract Governance Migration
**Target Ruleset**: `akao:ruleset:architecture:interface:contract_governance:v1`
**Governance Domain**: Interface contracts and cross-component communication

| Original Rule | Original Category | Migration Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| validation:rule_verification | validation | Adapted for interface contract governance and validation |

**Architectural Justification**: Interface governance requires systematic contract validation across all component boundaries, supporting future universal parser integration.

### 6. Evolution Architecture Change Governance Migration
**Target Ruleset**: `akao:ruleset:architecture:evolution:change_governance:v1`
**Governance Domain**: Change management and architectural evolution

| Original Rule | Original Category | Migration Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| rule:rule_compliance | rule | Core to evolution governance and change management |

**Architectural Justification**: Evolution governance ensures systematic architectural transformation while maintaining compliance and integrity.

## Eliminated Components

### Cross-Project Validation Integration
| Original Rule | Integration Target | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| validation:cross_project | System Architecture Governance | Cross-component validation part of system governance |

### Self-Validation Elimination
| Eliminated Rule | Replacement Strategy | Rationale |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| validation:self_validation | Universal Validation System (Phase 1 Step 4) | Resolves validation paradox through universal approach |

## Architectural Governance Benefits

### 1. Systematic Governance Enablement
- **Unified Architectural Principles**: All governance categories align with architectural intent
- **Cross-Language Consistency**: Governance applies uniformly regardless of implementation language
- **Systematic Management**: Clear governance domains enable systematic architectural management

### 2. Governance Fragmentation Elimination
- **Domain-Based Organization**: Rules organized by architectural function rather than arbitrary language boundaries
- **Unified Standards**: Consistent governance standards across all system components
- **Architectural Coherence**: Organization reflects actual system architecture relationships

### 3. Evolution Support Enhancement
- **Future-Ready Structure**: Architecture-based organization supports future technology evolution
- **Universal Parser Ready**: Governance structure compatible with language-agnostic parsing
- **Runtime Architecture Support**: Organization aligns with future Akao runtime development

## Semantic Validation Results

### Semantic Mapping Framework Verification
