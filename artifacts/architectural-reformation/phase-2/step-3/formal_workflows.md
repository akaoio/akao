## Core Development Principles

### Mandatory Principles

1. **Archaeological Preservation**: All development activities must be completely documented for future reconstruction
2. **Systematic Governance**: Every component must comply with akao identification standards
3. **Universal Validation**: All code must pass universal validation without self-validation paradox
4. **Quality-Driven Development**: Data-driven decisions based on objective quality metrics
5. **Knowledge Continuity**: Systematic knowledge transfer for future development generations

### Non-Negotiable Standards

- **akao Namespace Compliance**: All components must have valid akao namespace identification
- **Metadata Completeness**: All mandatory metadata fields must be populated
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: All references must resolve successfully
- **Naming Convention Adherence**: Strict adherence to akao naming conventions
- **Archaeological Documentation**: Complete decision and process documentation

## Component Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning and Design

#### Step 1.1: Component Specification
```bash
# Required Actions:
1. Define component purpose and scope
2. Assign akao namespace ID following pattern:
   akao:[type]:[category]:[subcategory]:[name]:[version]
3. Complete all mandatory metadata fields:
   - specification (10-100 words)
   - scope (architectural boundaries)
   - timeline (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - rationale (existence justification)
   - methodology (implementation approach)
   - references (related components)

# Validation Checkpoint:
- Run: akao validate component-spec --namespace-format --metadata-completeness
- Criteria: 100% compliance required to proceed
```

#### Step 1.2: Architecture Integration Assessment
```bash
# Required Actions:
1. Assess integration with existing systems
2. Identify dependencies and relationships
3. Evaluate impact on architectural coherence
4. Document integration approach

# Archaeological Documentation:
- Create design decision document
- Document alternatives considered
- Record rationale for chosen approach
- Preserve integration assessment results
```

#### Step 1.3: Implementation Planning
```bash
# Required Actions:
1. Break down implementation into measurable steps
2. Define validation criteria for each step
3. Establish quality thresholds
4. Plan testing and validation approach

# Deliverables:
- implementation_plan.yaml (with akao metadata)
- validation_criteria.yaml
- quality_thresholds.yaml
```

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### Step 2.1: File Creation and Header Compliance
```bash
# For all code files:
1. Create file with proper akao header:
/**
 * @id: akao:[type]:[category]:[subcategory]:[name]:[version]
 * @doc: [20-200 words user documentation]
 * @specification: [10-100 words technical specification]
 * @scope: [architectural boundaries]
 * @timeline: [YYYY-MM-DD]
 * @rationale: [existence justification]
 * @methodology: [implementation approach]
 * @references: [array of related akao IDs]
 */

2. Follow naming conventions:
   - Files: v1.cpp, v2.hpp (version-based)
   - Functions: camelCase
   - Classes: PascalCase
   - Variables: camelCase

# Validation:
- Automated compliance checking on save
- Blocking errors prevent commits
```

#### Step 2.2: Incremental Development with Continuous Validation
```bash
# Development Loop:
1. Implement component functionality
2. Run automated compliance validation:
   akao validate --file [filepath] --blocking-only
3. Run quality assessment:

4. Document implementation decisions
5. Update archaeological records

# Continuous Requirements:
- All commits must pass compliance validation
- Quality scores must meet minimum thresholds
- Archaeological documentation must be current
```

#### Step 2.3: Integration Testing
```bash
# Integration Validation:
1. Test component integration with existing systems
2. Validate cross-reference resolution
3. Verify naming convention compliance
4. Test universal validation compatibility

# Required Tests:
- Unit tests for component functionality

## Workflow Compliance and Validation

All workflows in this document are mandatory and subject to:

1. **Automated Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of workflow adherence
2. **Quality Assessment**: Regular evaluation of workflow effectiveness
3. **Archaeological Preservation**: Complete documentation of workflow execution
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Data-driven workflow enhancement
5. **Universal Validation**: Compatibility with akao universal validation system

**Enforcement**: Non-compliance with these workflows constitutes a blocking issue and prevents system operations until resolved.

**Evolution**: These workflows are living documents subject to systematic improvement based on archaeological data analysis and effectiveness measurement.
