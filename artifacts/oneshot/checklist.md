# Oneshot Branch Implementation Checklist

## Branch Information
- **Branch**: oneshot
- **Purpose**: Architectural reformation to address critical issues identified in overview.md
- **Timeline**: Single session implementation (90 minutes maximum)
- **Quality Standard**: 100% compliance with all success criteria

## Phase 1: Critical Self-Validation Fixes (45 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Analyze Structure Violations (15 minutes)
- [ ] Deep dive into 56 structure violations
- [ ] Map violations to specific architectural rules
- [ ] Create targeted fixes for each violation category
- [ ] Generate temporary unit tests for validation
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase1/step1/structure_violation_test.cpp`

### Step 1.2: Fix Architectural Compliance (20 minutes)
- [ ] Resolve fundamental architecture issues causing 0% compliance
- [ ] Align file structure with philosophy requirements
- [ ] Verify one-file-per-directory compliance
- [ ] Validate naming convention adherence
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase1/step2/architecture_compliance_test.cpp`

### Step 1.3: Verify Self-Validation Success (10 minutes)
- [ ] Execute full self-validation suite
- [ ] Confirm 0 violations detected
- [ ] Achieve >95% quality score
- [ ] Validate architectural compliance reaches 100%
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase1/step3/self_validation_complete_test.cpp`

## Phase 2: Test Framework Enhancement (25 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Fix Failing Tests (15 minutes)
- [ ] Resolve validate command test failure
- [ ] Fix structure compliance test (currently failing due to 56 violations)
- [ ] Add proper output validation to existing tests
- [ ] Ensure all assertions validate actual vs expected outcomes
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase2/step1/failing_test_fixes_test.cpp`

### Step 2.2: Enhance Test Quality (10 minutes)
- [ ] Add state verification after command execution
- [ ] Include edge case testing where missing
- [ ] Replace decorative assertions with meaningful validations
- [ ] Achieve 100% test success rate
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase2/step2/test_quality_enhancement_test.cpp`

## Phase 3: Code Quality Cleanup (20 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Resolve Compilation Warnings (10 minutes)
- [ ] Fix unused parameter warnings throughout codebase
- [ ] Complete implementation stubs marked as incomplete
- [ ] Ensure clean compilation with zero warnings
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase3/step1/compilation_clean_test.cpp`

### Step 3.2: Final Validation (10 minutes)
- [ ] Execute complete test suite
- [ ] Verify self-validation passes completely
- [ ] Confirm all CLI commands operational
- [ ] Validate universal validation functionality
- [ ] **Unit Test**: `tmp/oneshot/phase3/step2/final_validation_test.cpp`

## Mandatory Success Criteria

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Self-validation reports 0 violations
- [ ] All test suite passes (100% success rate)
- [ ] Clean compilation (zero warnings)
- [ ] Universal validation functionality confirmed operational
- [ ] All CLI commands functional and tested

### Quality Metrics Targets
- [ ] Self-validation quality score: â‰¥95%
- [ ] Architectural compliance: 100%
- [ ] Test success rate: 100%
- [ ] Philosophy compliance: All 15 philosophies satisfied
- [ ] Performance: No regression in execution speed

## Anti-Fraud Test Requirements

Each unit test must include:
- **Explicit Input Data**: Concrete test cases with known inputs
- **Expected Output Specifications**: Exact expected results defined
- **Actual Implementation Calls**: Real function invocations, not mocks
- **Assertion-Based Validation**: Pass/fail criteria based on objective comparisons

## Implementation Constraints

### Immutable Requirements
- **Checkbox Content**: Checklist items cannot be modified during implementation, only marked complete
- **Single Session**: All work must complete within one development session
- **Quality Standards**: No regression in existing functionality
- **Verification**: Each step requires objective validation before proceeding

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Progress**: Each step is independently verifiable
- **Rollback Capability**: Git-based checkpoint after each major step
- **Conservative Scope**: Focus on critical path only
- **Time Management**: Hard stop at 90 minutes with current progress documented

## Notes
- All temporary unit tests located in `tmp/oneshot/{phase}/{step}/`
- Each test must validate real functionality, not mock implementations
- Progress tracking required after each major milestone
- Quality gates: No proceeding to next phase until current phase verified
