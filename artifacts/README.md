# Artifacts Directory

This directory serves as the centralized repository for all development artifacts, build outputs, and archaeological data generated during the system development lifecycle. It implements a branch-based organizational strategy for systematic artifact management and historical preservation.

## Overview

The artifacts directory establishes a structured approach to development artifact management, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and knowledge preservation across development iterations. This system enables future agents and developers to reconstruct development decisions, understand architectural evolution, and maintain continuity across project phases.

## Directory Structure

### Branch-Based Partitioning

Each development branch is allocated a dedicated subdirectory following the naming convention:
```
artifacts/{branch_name}/
```

**Example**: For the `main` branch, all artifacts are stored under `artifacts/main/`

### Mandatory Components

Each branch partition (`artifacts/{branch}/`) must contain the following standardized components:

#### 1. plan.yaml - Strategic Development Plan

A comprehensive technical plan adhering to systematic engineering principles:

**Content Requirements:**
- **Context Definition**: Comprehensive specification of what, where, when, why, and how
- **Research References**: Complete URLs and documentation sources required for implementation
- **Objective Specification**: Concrete, measurable goals and deliverables
- **Phase Decomposition**: Structured breakdown into logical development phases
- **Step Granularity**: Detailed step-by-step execution within each phase

**Generation Pipeline:**
```
Prompt Template → Formal Prompt → plan.yaml → Validation (akao validate)
```

**Compliance**: Must conform to system-wide identification standards and metadata schemas

**Archaeological Significance**: Serves as the primary historical record for understanding development intent and decision-making processes

#### 2. Phase/Step Directories - Archaeological Data Structure

**Directory Pattern**: `artifacts/{branch}/{phase}/{step}/`

**Purpose:**
- **Historical Preservation**: Maintains comprehensive development archaeology
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enables future intelligent agents to trace and understand previous generation thinking patterns
- **Process Reconstruction**: Allows complete reconstruction of development methodology and decision trees
- **Continuous Improvement**: Provides data foundation for iterative process enhancement

**Content Standards:**
- All files must comply with system-wide identification standards (pending implementation)
- Comprehensive documentation of decisions, alternatives considered, and rationale
- Preservation of intermediate artifacts and development artifacts

#### 3. quality.yaml - Branch Quality Assessment

**Purpose**: Provides quantitative and qualitative assessment of branch development quality

**Data Sources:**
- Archaeological data analysis from phase/step directories
- Compliance metrics with established standards
- Code quality indicators
- Test coverage and validation results

**Usage**: Primary input for branch merge decision-making processes

## System Integration

### Identification Standards

All artifacts must conform to the system-wide identification and metadata standards (currently under development). This ensures:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Standardized metadata attachment
- Cross-reference capability
- Automated processing compatibility

### Quality Assurance

The artifact management system integrates with the broader akao validation framework to ensure:
- Structural compliance
- Content quality verification
- Metadata completeness
- Archaeological data integrity

## Implementation Status

**Current State**: Core framework established
**Pending Development**: 
- Mandatory partitioning rules implementation
- System-wide identification standards
- Automated quality assessment integration
- Archaeological data mining capabilities

## Benefits

1. **Traceability**: Complete development history preservation
2. **Reproducibility**: Ability to reconstruct any development state
3. **Knowledge Continuity**: Systematic knowledge transfer across development generations
4. **Quality Control**: Data-driven branch quality assessment
5. **Process Improvement**: Archaeological data enables systematic process enhancement
