# Phase 1 Architecture Audit Report

## Architecture Violations Detected

### 1. One-File-Per-Directory Rule Violations

The following directories contain more than 2 files (max allowed: .cpp/.hpp pair):

#### Critical Violations:
- `core/engine/logic/` - Contains 18 files (should be split into subdirectories)
  - Files: builtin_functions, cpp_functions, datalog_engine, filesystem_functions, formal_system, godel_encoding, incompleteness_proofs, meta_functions, pure_logic_engine
  - **MUST RESTRUCTURE**: Each component should have its own subdirectory with v1.cpp/v1.hpp

#### Other Violations:
- `core/engine/validator/` - Contains 4 files
- `core/engine/parser/` - Contains 4 files  
- `interfaces/cli/commands/` - Contains 12 files

### 2. Version Naming Convention Violations

All files currently use descriptive names instead of version naming (v0, v1, v2).

#### Examples:
- `core/engine/logic/pure_logic_engine.cpp` should be `core/engine/logic/pure/v1.cpp`
- `core/rule/loader/rule_loader.cpp` should be `core/rule/loader/v1.cpp`

### 3. Missing System Components

#### Missing Directories:
- ✅ `rulesets/` - CREATED with initial C++ structure standards ruleset
- ❌ Dynamic management system infrastructure  
- ❌ Runtime enable/disable components
- ❌ Lazy loading infrastructure

### 4. Architectural Relationship Issues

#### Philosophy-Rule-Ruleset Dependencies:
- ✅ Rules correctly link to philosophies
- ✅ Created first ruleset with philosophy dependencies
- ❌ Missing runtime dependency validation
- ❌ No dynamic management capabilities

## Phase 1 Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Architecture Compliance Restructuring
1. Restructure `core/engine/logic/` into proper subdirectories
2. Implement version naming across all source files
3. Validate one-file-per-directory compliance

### Step 2: Dynamic Management Infrastructure  
1. Create runtime control interfaces
2. Implement lazy loading system
3. Add user management capabilities

### Step 3: Pure Logic Engine Integration Analysis
1. Document current Pure Logic Engine API
2. Assess integration points for philosophies/rules/rulesets
3. Create compatibility matrix

### Step 4: Semantic Disambiguation Framework
1. Analyze current validation pipeline
2. Implement semantic clarity improvements
3. Create enhanced error categorization

## Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [ ] All directories comply with one-file-per-directory rule
- [ ] All source files use version naming convention
- [ ] Dynamic management system operational
- [ ] Rulesets directory with proper management
- [ ] Pure Logic Engine integration points documented
- [ ] Semantic disambiguation framework implemented
