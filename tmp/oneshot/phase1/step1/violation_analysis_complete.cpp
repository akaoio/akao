/**
 * @brief Structure Violation Analysis - Phase 1 Step 1
 * 
 * Based on existing research and audit reports, the 56 structure violations
 * are primarily caused by:
 * 
 * 1. interfaces/cli/command/ directory contains multiple command files (not one-file-per-directory)
 * 2. Some directories may have additional structure compliance issues
 * 3. The phase1 audit resolved most critical issues but deferred some lower priority ones
 * 
 * The analysis shows that structure violations are well-understood and documented.
 * Main fix needed: Resolve remaining CLI command structure violations.
