# üéØ AKAO Pure Logic Engine Implementation Guide

## üåü **CONTEXT & PROBLEM STATEMENT**

You are tasked with implementing a **Pure Logic Engine** for the AKAO framework. This is a fundamental architectural shift where:

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: The engine is a pure runtime interpreter with ZERO hardcoded domain logic. All rules, philosophies, and validation logic are defined in YAML files, making the system completely data-driven and extensible.

**Current State**: AKAO has a basic C++ structure with hardcoded validation logic scattered across different components.

**Target State**: A formal logic system where:
- Engine only knows how to parse and execute logic expressions
- All domain knowledge (rules, philosophies) lives in YAML files  
- Each rule/philosophy can self-prove its correctness via logic it defines
- The system is Turing-complete and supports complex recursion
- All development artifacts are contained in `tmp/`

## üèóÔ∏è **SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE**

### **1. Pure Logic Engine Core**
```cpp
class PureLogicEngine {
    // Pure interpreter - no domain knowledge
    Value executeLogic(const YAML::Node& logic, Context& ctx);
    bool evaluateCondition(const YAML::Node& condition, Context& ctx);
    Value executeFunction(const string& func, const vector<Value>& args);
    Value executeOperator(const string& op, const vector<Value>& args);
};
```

### **2. YAML Logic Language**
```yaml
# Complete Turing-complete syntax supporting:
logic:
  forall/exists:     # Quantifiers
    variable: "x"
    domain: <expr>
    condition: <expr>
  
  operator: "and|or|not|equals|less_than"  # Logical/comparison ops
  left/right: <expr>
  
  function: "func_name"  # Built-in function calls
  argument/arguments: <expr>
  
  if/then/else: <expr>   # Conditionals
  
  fixpoint:              # Recursion support
    variable: "f"
    parameter: "x"  
    body: <expr>
    argument: <expr>
```

### **3. Self-Validation System**
Every rule and philosophy must include:
```yaml
self_validation:
  logic: <expression>  # Self-proof logic
  
unit_tests:
  - name: "test_case"
    setup: <mock_context>
    expected: <result>
```

- [ ] Every philosophy proves its self_proof logic  
- [ ] Meta-rules validate all rules and philosophies
- [ ] System can prove it contains no contradictions

- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Self-validation catches actual logic errors

### **5. Code Quality**
- [ ] All code follows AKAO's own rules (validated by system itself)
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage
- [ ] Clear documentation and examples
- [ ] All temporary files in `tmp/` directory

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The implementation is complete when:

1. **The engine is a pure interpreter** - contains zero domain logic
2. **All validation is YAML-driven** - rules and philosophies in YAML
3. **System is self-validating** - each component proves its own correctness
4. **Logic is Turing-complete** - supports complex recursion and proofs
5. **Integration is seamless** - CLI works via engine, same functionality
6. **Quality is maintained** - all existing tests pass, code follows rules

## üö® **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**

- **Work step-by-step**: Complete each phase fully before moving to next
- **Test everything**: Every component must have unit tests
- **Self-validate**: Every rule/philosophy must include self-validation
- **Keep tmp/ clean**: All development artifacts in tmp/ directory only
- **Document decisions**: Clear comments explaining design choices
- **Follow the plan**: Stick to this checklist, ask for clarification if needed

## üîÑ **ITERATIVE APPROACH**

1. **Start simple**: Basic expressions first, then build complexity
2. **Test early**: Write tests as you implement, not after
3. **Validate continuously**: Run self-validation after each change  
4. **Refactor carefully**: Keep the pure interpreter principle
5. **Ask questions**: If unclear about requirements, ask for clarification

**BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION**: Start with Phase 1, Step 1.1 - Create the Pure Logic Engine skeleton. Work methodically through each step, testing as you go.
