## Core Principles {#akao:doc::philosophy:core_principles:v1}

> **Implementation Note**: Each principle below is technically enforced through automated systems and implemented according to deterministic specifications. The AI-executable manifestation of these principles enables complete automation from philosophy to production deployment.

### 1. Rule-Centric System Core {#akao:doc::philosophy:rule_centric_system_core:v1}

All behavior must be governed by versioned, testable rules. Every action, validation, build, and deployment must be traceable to explicit rules with Global Rule Identifiers (GIDs) in the format `akao:rule::<category>:<name>:v<version>`. Rules are not suggestions—they are laws that govern system behavior with complete auditability and enforcement.

### 2. AI-Native Execution {#akao:doc::philosophy:ai_native_execution:v1}

The system is designed to be driven, maintained, and extended by AI agents without human intervention. Every operation must be expressible through machine-readable interfaces with deterministic outcomes. AI agents must be able to regenerate the entire system from philosophical foundations to production deployment following automated workflows.

### 3. Determinism & Reproducibility {#akao:doc::philosophy:determinism_reproducibility:v1}

Every action must be repeatable and independently verifiable. Given identical inputs and conditions, the system must produce identical outputs across all environments, platforms, and execution contexts. This ensures reliable automation and eliminates "works on my machine" failures.

### 4. Observability & Auditability {#akao:doc::philosophy:observability_auditability:v1}

All behavior and artifacts must be logged and auditable. Every rule execution, validation result, build step, and system state change must be recorded with complete traceability. The audit trail must be machine-readable and enable forensic analysis of all system behavior.

### 5. Single Source Documentation (Docgen) {#akao:doc::philosophy:single_source_docgen:v1}

A single engine generates all documentation and plans from living code and rules. Hand-written documentation lies by omission and becomes stale by neglect. Generated documentation cannot lie because it is extracted from the actual, tested, and validated system implementation.

### 6. Modular, Composable, Extensible {#akao:doc::philosophy:modular_composable_extensible:v1}

System components are fully decoupled and extensible via plugins. Each module must define clear interfaces, declare explicit dependencies, and operate independently. Features must work together without conflicts or hidden dependencies through well-defined composition patterns.

### 7. Interface Parity & Consistency {#akao:doc::philosophy:interface_parity_consistency:v1}

CLI, Web, API, and MCP must expose the same capabilities and logic. The interface is merely the skin; the underlying logic must be invariant. Users can switch interfaces without relearning workflows or encountering inconsistent behavior. Every operation available in one interface must be available in all interfaces.

### 8. Structural Enforcement {#akao:doc::philosophy:structural_enforcement:v1}

All file/folder/naming/layout conventions must be rule-enforced. Structure is not suggestion—it is the fundamental law that governs all code existence. Structural violations are treated as compilation errors, making disorder impossible rather than inconvenient.

### 9. Fail-Fast + Self-Healing {#akao:doc::philosophy:fail_fast_self_healing:v1}

Catch problems early, offer corrective suggestions or autofix. When violations occur, the system must provide not just identification but education and remediation. Each violation becomes a teaching moment with forensic evidence and guided resolution paths.

### 10. Resource-Aware Scalability {#akao:doc::philosophy:resource_aware_scalability:v1}

Works from local to distributed scale with controlled resource usage. The system must adapt to available resources while maintaining consistent behavior patterns. Resource consumption must be measurable, predictable, and optimizable across deployment scales.

### 11. Privacy, Legal, and Compliance by Design {#akao:doc::philosophy:privacy_legal_compliance:v1}

Complies with SBOM, licensing, consent, and audit requirements from system foundation. Privacy and compliance are not add-ons—they are architectural requirements built into every component. All data handling, dependency management, and external integrations must meet audit standards.

### 12. Interoperability & No Lock-in {#akao:doc::philosophy:interoperability_no_lockin:v1}

Everything should be importable/exportable, open-format, vendor-neutral. Users must retain complete control over their data, configurations, and artifacts. The system facilitates migration to and from other tools through standardized formats and clear export capabilities.

### 13. Convention Over Configuration {#akao:doc::philosophy:convention_over_configuration:v1}

Sensible defaults should reduce config overhead while maintaining complete customizability. The system should work optimally with minimal configuration while providing comprehensive control when needed. Conventions must be discoverable, logical, and overrideable.

### 14. Global Traceability & Orphan Prevention {#akao:doc::philosophy:global_traceability_orphan_prevention:v1}

Every rule, plan, doc, and config must be ID-addressable and referenced. No section, component, or artifact may remain unreferenced or untraceable. The global ID system `akao:doc::<type>:<slug>:v1` ensures complete navigability and prevents orphaned content.

### 15. Community-Led Transparency & Ethics {#akao:doc::philosophy:community_transparency_ethics:v1}

Supports public audit, ethics-first design, and forkability. All design decisions must be transparent, auditable, and ethically sound. The community must be able to examine, critique, and fork any aspect of the system. Ethics considerations are primary design constraints.

### 16. Self-Monitoring & Auto-Planning {#akao:doc::philosophy:self_monitoring_auto_planning:v1}

The system should know what's missing, and auto-generate the next steps. Through continuous self-analysis, the system identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities. It generates action plans for remediation and enhancement automatically.

### 17. Security-by-Architecture {#akao:doc::philosophy:security_by_architecture:v1}

System-wide design must prevent leakage, spoofing, escalation. Security is not a feature—it is a fundamental architectural property. Every component, interface, and data flow must be designed with security-first principles preventing attack vectors by design.

### 18. Language-Agnostic Enforcement {#akao:doc::philosophy:language_agnostic_enforcement:v1}

Works across language stacks, enforces structure agnostically. Rules and validations must apply consistently whether the codebase is C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust, or polyglot. Language-specific implementations must conform to universal structural and behavioral requirements.

### 19. Rule Integrity Across Lifecycle {#akao:doc::philosophy:rule_integrity_lifecycle:v1}

Rules must remain valid and enforced through design, code, and ops. From initial design through production operations, rules must maintain their integrity and enforcement power. Lifecycle transitions cannot weaken rule enforcement or introduce compliance gaps.

## System Foundation {#akao:doc::philosophy:system_foundation:v1}

These principles form the immutable foundation for all system design, implementation, and operation decisions. Every feature, component, and workflow must demonstrably align with and enforce these philosophical requirements.

### Automation Workflow {#akao:doc::philosophy:automation_workflow:v1}

The complete automation path follows this deterministic sequence:

1. **Philosophy** (this document) → defines immutable principles
2. **Documentation** → generated from philosophy with full traceability  
3. **Plan** → implements every principle without exception
4. **Rules** → encode plan requirements as executable validation
5. **Configuration** → expresses rules in machine-readable format
6. **Code** → implements configuration with rule compliance
7. **Tests** → verify code adherence to all rules and principles
8. **Reports** → audit complete workflow execution and compliance

This workflow must be executable by AI agents without human intervention, producing identical results across all execution environments.

### Traceability Matrix {#akao:doc::philosophy:traceability_matrix:v1}

Every system artifact must be traceable through the complete chain:

- **Principle** ↔ **Architecture Component** ↔ **Implementation Plan** ↔ **Rule Definition** ↔ **Code Implementation** ↔ **Test Validation** ↔ **Audit Report**

The bidirectional traceability ensures that any change to principles cascades through all dependent artifacts, and any implementation detail can be traced back to its philosophical foundation.

## Implementation Guidelines {#akao:doc::philosophy:implementation_guidelines:v1}

### AI Agent Requirements {#akao:doc::philosophy:ai_agent_requirements:v1}

AI agents operating this system must:

1. **Read and comprehend** this philosophy document completely
2. **Generate architecture** that implements every principle
3. **Create implementation plans** covering all architecture components
4. **Define rules** that enforce all plan requirements
5. **Write code** that satisfies all rule validations
6. **Create tests** that verify complete principle compliance
7. **Generate reports** that audit the entire workflow

### Deterministic Execution {#akao:doc::philosophy:deterministic_execution:v1}

Every operation must be:

- **Repeatable**: Same inputs → Same outputs
- **Traceable**: Complete audit trail of all actions
- **Verifiable**: Independent validation of all results  
- **Reversible**: Ability to understand and undo changes
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable metrics for all operations

### Quality Gates {#akao:doc::philosophy:quality_gates:v1}

Before any artifact advancement:

1. **Philosophy Compliance**: Must align with all 19 principles
2. **Traceability Verification**: All references must resolve to valid IDs
3. **Automation Validation**: Must be executable without human intervention
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Must work identically across all target platforms
5. **Security Audit**: Must pass all security and compliance requirements

---

## Verification Requirements {#akao:doc::philosophy:verification_requirements:v1}

### Compliance Testing {#akao:doc::philosophy:compliance_testing:v1}

Every principle must have:

- **Positive tests**: Verify correct implementation
- **Negative tests**: Verify violation detection
- **Edge case tests**: Verify boundary condition handling
- **Integration tests**: Verify principle interactions
- **Regression tests**: Verify principle preservation across changes

### Audit Standards {#akao:doc::philosophy:audit_standards:v1}

All artifacts must:

- **Reference valid IDs**: No broken or orphaned references
- **Maintain bidirectional traceability**: Forward and reverse navigation
- **Include version information**: Enable change tracking and rollback
- **Provide machine-readable metadata**: Support automated processing
- **Generate compliance reports**: Enable audit trail verification

This philosophy document serves as the immutable foundation for the entire Akao system, ensuring that every component, feature, and workflow aligns with these deterministic, AI-executable, and auditable principles.
