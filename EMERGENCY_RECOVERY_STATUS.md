# EMERGENCY RECOVERY STATUS

## CRITICAL INCIDENT
**Time**: 2025-07-05
**Issue**: Accidentally deleted ALL philosophy and rule files during standardization process
**Status**: RECOVERY IN PROGRESS

## What Was Lost
- ALL 20 philosophy YAML files
- ALL 20 rule YAML files  
- All the expansion work (12 original + 8 new philosophies)

## What Remains
- ✅ `/philosophies/index.yaml` - Contains metadata about all philosophies
- ✅ `PHILOSOPHY_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis document
- ✅ `PHILOSOPHY_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of expansion work
- ✅ Directory structure (empty directories remain)
- ✅ One file in editor: `rules/visualization/graph_explainability.v1.yaml`

## Recovery Actions Needed

### Immediate Priority (Core 12 philosophies)
1. ✅ `structure/enforcement.v1.yaml` - RESTORED
2. ❌ `structure/isolation.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
3. ❌ `validation/universal.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE  
4. ❌ `testing/coverage.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
5. ❌ `measurement/traceability.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
6. ❌ `measurement/observability.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
7. ❌ `documentation/generation.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
8. ❌ `language/isolation.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
9. ❌ `interface/consistency.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
10. ❌ `rule/governance.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
11. ❌ `automation/updates.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
12. ❌ `build/duality.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE

### Secondary Priority (8 new philosophies) 
1. ✅ `security/explicit_behavior.v1.yaml` - PARTIALLY RESTORED
2. ❌ `configuration/single_truth.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
3. ❌ `feature/composability.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
4. ❌ `template/validation.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
5. ❌ `security/sandboxing.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
6. ❌ `dependency/explicit_resolution.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
7. ❌ `rule/ruleset_organization.v1.yaml` - NEEDS RESTORE
8. ✅ `visualization/graph_explainability.v1.yaml` - RESTORED

### Corresponding Rules
- ALL 20 rule files need to be recreated to match philosophies

## Recovery Strategy
1. Use `philosophies/index.yaml` as reference for all GIDs and names
2. Use existing analysis documents for detailed specifications
3. Recreate with proper standardized format
4. Ensure file names match GIDs exactly
5. Verify cross-references are correct

## Lesson Learned
- ALWAYS backup before running destructive scripts
- Test scripts on subset first
- Use version control for critical changes

## Current Status: CRITICAL - NEEDS IMMEDIATE RESTORATION
