- **GID**: `akao:philosophy::feature:composability:v1`
- **Category**: `feature`
- **Rule**: `akao:rule::feature:composability:v1`
- **Overlap Risk**: LOW - Distinct architecture concept

### 4. **Templates are validated** ✅ ADDED
- **GID**: `akao:philosophy::template:validation:v1`
- **Category**: `template`
- **Rule**: `akao:rule::template:validation:v1`
- **Overlap Risk**: MEDIUM - Kept separate from validation/universal

### 5. **External features are sandboxed** ✅ ADDED
- **GID**: `akao:philosophy::security:sandboxing:v1`
- **Category**: `security`
- **Rule**: `akao:rule::security:sandboxing:v1`
- **Overlap Risk**: LOW - Distinct security concept

### 6. **Dependency resolution is explicit** ✅ ADDED
- **GID**: `akao:philosophy::dependency:explicit_resolution:v1`
- **Category**: `dependency`
- **Rule**: `akao:rule::dependency:explicit_resolution:v1`
- **Overlap Risk**: MEDIUM - Kept separate from security/explicit_behavior

### 7. **Every rule is part of at least one RuleSet** ✅ ADDED
- **GID**: `akao:philosophy::rule:ruleset_organization:v1`
- **Category**: `rule`
- **Rule**: `akao:rule::rule:ruleset_organization:v1`
- **Overlap Risk**: MEDIUM - Kept separate from rule/governance

### 8. **Code must be graph-explorable and visually explainable** ✅ ADDED (MERGED)
- **GID**: `akao:philosophy::visualization:graph_explainability:v1`
- **Category**: `visualization`
- **Rule**: `akao:rule::visualization:graph_explainability:v1`
- **Overlap Risk**: HIGH - Successfully merged two related concepts

## Philosophies Deliberately NOT Added

### **Observable, explainable, deterministic** ❌ NOT ADDED
- **Reason**: HIGH overlap with existing `measurement/observability` and `measurement/traceability`
- **Analysis**: Would create confusion and redundancy
- **Alternative**: Enhanced existing measurement philosophies instead

## Recommendations Implemented

### ✅ Successfully Added Low-Risk Philosophies
1. No external implicit behavior
2. Features are composable  
3. External features are sandboxed
4. Code must be graph-explorable

### ✅ Successfully Added Medium-Risk Philosophies (with careful separation)
1. Only one truth (separated from rule/governance)
2. Templates are validated (separated from validation/universal)
3. Dependency resolution is explicit (separated from security/explicit_behavior)
4. Every rule is part of at least one RuleSet (separated from rule/governance)

### ✅ Successfully Merged High-Risk Philosophies
1. "Code must be graph-explorable" + "All logic must be explainable visually" → `visualization/graph_explainability`

### ✅ Successfully Avoided High-Risk Conflicts
1. Did not add "Observable, explainable, deterministic" to prevent overlap with measurement philosophies

## Framework Status
- **Philosophy Framework**: COMPLETE ✅
- **Rule Framework**: COMPLETE ✅
- **Coverage Status**: COMPREHENSIVE ✅
- **Quality Status**: HIGH ✅
- **Maintainability**: EXCELLENT ✅

The Akao philosophy framework now comprehensively covers all concepts from PHILOSOPHY.md with minimal overlap and maximum clarity.
