- [ ] Test validates architectural fixes with specific file checks
- [ ] Confirm compliance score calculation is tested
- [ ] Create `tmp/oneshot/phase1/step3/self_validation_complete_test.cpp`

- [ ] Assert quality score meets >95% threshold

### Phase 2 Unit Tests  
- [ ] Create `tmp/oneshot/phase2/step1/failing_test_fixes_test.cpp`
- [ ] Test validates previously failing tests now pass
- [ ] Confirm actual command execution is tested, not simulated
- [ ] Create `tmp/oneshot/phase2/step2/test_quality_enhancement_test.cpp`
- [ ] Test verifies enhanced assertions work correctly
- [ ] Assert test framework correctly identifies both pass and fail conditions

### Phase 3 Unit Tests
- [ ] Create `tmp/oneshot/phase3/step1/compilation_clean_test.cpp`
- [ ] Test verifies compilation produces zero warnings
- [ ] Confirm all implementation stubs are completed
- [ ] Create `tmp/oneshot/phase3/step2/final_validation_test.cpp`
- [ ] Test comprehensive system validation
- [ ] Assert all integration points work correctly

## COMPLETION VALIDATION

Upon completion of all checklist items:
- [ ] Execute `make clean && make && make run-tests` successfully
- [ ] Run `./build/bin/akao validate .` and confirm 0 violations
- [ ] Verify `./build/bin/akao --help` shows all commands

**CRITICAL NOTE**: No checkbox content in this checklist may be modified during implementation. Items may only be marked as completed (- [x]) after objective verification of the completion criterion.

**SESSION CONSTRAINT**: All items must be completed within single development session (90 minutes maximum). If time constraint is reached, document current progress and remaining items for future sessions.
