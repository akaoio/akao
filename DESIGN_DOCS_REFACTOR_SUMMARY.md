## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive refactor of Akao framework design documents based on the requirements to:
1. Remove "Self-Validation" as a principle
2. Add automation and CI/CD capabilities 
3. Fix consistency gaps from evaluation report
4. Remove duplication and ensure cross-file consistency
5. Make documents implementation-ready

- **Enhanced Capabilities List**:
  - Added "Automated CI/CD pipeline generation" to core capabilities

### 3. Consistency Issues Resolution

**Files Modified**: All design documents

**Key Fixes**:

- **CLI=Web=TUI Interface Consistency**:
  - Added detailed `InterfaceController` class specification in PLAN.md
  - Defined `CommandRequest`/`CommandResponse` abstraction
  - Specified `WebInterface` and `TUIInterface` classes
  - Added validation methods to ensure interface parity
  - Emphasized identical functionality across all interfaces

- **Naming Standardization**:
  - Resolved FEATURES.md vs PRINCIPLES.md inconsistency
  - Standardized to use both: PRINCIPLES.md for principles, FEATURES.md for features
  - Updated all file references across documents

- **Feature Security & Sandboxing**:
  - Added comprehensive `FeatureSecurity` class specification
  - Defined `SecurityContext` and `ResourceLimits` structures
  - Added security validation methods for external features
  - Specified sandboxing mechanisms for feature execution

- **Plugin Testing Strategy**:
  - Added `PluginTestFramework` class specification
  - Defined plugin functionality, security, and compatibility testing
  - Added plugin violation tracking and compliance validation
  - Created example test cases for plugin validation

- **Principle Testing Framework**:
  - Replaced self-validation tests with comprehensive principle testing
  - Added `PrincipleTestFramework` with individual principle tests
  - Created tests for all core principles (structure, validation, traceability, etc.)
  - Maintained ability to test Akao itself as standard test case

### 4. Metrics & Compliance System

**Files Modified**: `PLAN.md`

**New Additions**:

- **Comprehensive Metrics Framework**:
  - Added `ComplianceScorer` class for calculating compliance scores
  - Added `MetricsCollector` class for recording all actions and violations
  - Defined `ComplianceMetric` and `SystemMetrics` structures
  - Added historical compliance tracking

- **Compliance Reporting**:
  - Added `.akao/audit.json` format specification
  - Defined compliance report structure with scores, violations, recommendations
  - Added historical trend tracking and compliance thresholds
  - Enhanced audit commands with compliance scoring

### 5. Duplication Removal & Consistency

**Files Modified**: All design documents

**Improvements**:

- **Canonical Content Locations**:
  - Implementation details â†’ PLAN.md
  - Architecture & modules â†’ ARCHITECTURE.md  
  - Philosophy & principles â†’ PHILOSOPHY.md
  - CLI & user guidance â†’ README.md

- **Consistent Terminology**:
  - Standardized all CLI command descriptions across documents
  - Matched folder structures and class names
  - Ensured identical naming conventions

- **Cross-File Logic Consistency**:
  - Verified all design decisions are reflected across documents
  - Ensured automation capabilities are documented in all relevant files
  - Matched directory structures and component descriptions
