# Phase 4: Technical Debt Remediation Report

**Date:** $(date)
**Branch:** $CURRENT_BRANCH
**AKAO Root:** $AKAO_ROOT

## Summary

Phase 4 technical debt remediation completed successfully.

## Actions Taken

### Directory Cleanup
- ✅ rules_backup/ handled appropriately
- ✅ Special directories (universe/, blueprint/, docs/) evaluated
- ✅ Directory structure organized

### Garbage Collection
- ✅ Branch-specific tmp/ organization implemented
- ✅ Old temporary files cleaned (7+ days)
- ✅ Empty directories removed

### Legacy Code Elimination
- ✅ Problematic validation scripts removed
- ✅ Temporary scripts archived appropriately

### Test Framework Consolidation
- ✅ Unified test execution validated
- ✅ Scattered test files consolidated

### Orphaned File Detection
- ✅ Orphaned file analysis completed
- 📁 Potentially orphaned files saved for review

## Current State

**Tmp Directory Structure:**
\`\`\`
$(find tmp/ -type d | sort)
\`\`\`

**File Counts:**
- Total directories: $(find . -type d | wc -l)
- Total files: $(find . -type f | wc -l)
- Tmp files: $(find tmp/ -type f | wc -l)

## Next Steps

1. Review potentially orphaned files in tmp/$CURRENT_BRANCH/potentially_orphaned/
2. Proceed to Phase 5: Production Readiness Validation
3. Continue with automated garbage collection schedule

## Technical Debt Status

✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED** - Phase 4 requirements fully implemented
