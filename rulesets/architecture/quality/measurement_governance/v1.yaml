# Governance Framework
governance:
  enforcement_level: "mandatory"
  validation_scope: "universal"
  compliance_requirements:
    - "All system components must implement performance monitoring"
    - "Quality metrics must be systematically collected"
    - "Errors must be comprehensively reported with traceability"
    - "Violations must be tracked with archaeological preservation"
  
  violation_handling:
    - "Performance degradation triggers immediate investigation"
    - "Quality metric failures require root cause analysis"
    - "Error reporting gaps constitute governance violations"
    - "Violation tracking failures impact archaeological integrity"
  
  quality_metrics:
    - "Performance monitoring coverage >= 100%"
    - "Metrics collection completeness >= 98%"
