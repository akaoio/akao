# Integrated Rules
rules:
  - rule_id: "akao:rule::rule:rule_compliance:v1"
    governance_role: "primary"
    architectural_purpose: "Ensure rule compliance throughout architectural evolution and change processes"
    integration_rationale: "Core to evolution governance and change management"
    original_file: "rules/rule/rule_compliance/v1.yaml"

# Governance Framework
governance:
  enforcement_level: "mandatory"
  validation_scope: "universal"
  compliance_requirements:
    - "All architectural changes must maintain rule compliance"
    - "Evolution processes must be systematically governed"
    - "Change impact must be assessed and validated"
    - "Migration patterns must follow established governance"
  
  violation_handling:
    - "Non-compliant changes require immediate correction"
    - "Evolution process deviations constitute governance violations"
    - "Unassessed change impacts require architectural review"
    - "Migration pattern violations impact system integrity"
  
  quality_metrics:
    - "Rule compliance during evolution >= 100%"
    - "Change impact assessment coverage >= 98%"
    - "Evolution process adherence >= 95%"
    - "Migration pattern compliance >= 100%"

# Change Management Framework
change_management:
  change_categories:
    - "Architectural refactoring and improvement"
    - "Component migration and evolution"
    - "Interface contract modifications"
    - "Governance rule updates and enhancements"
  
  change_governance_requirements:
    - "Impact assessment for all architectural changes"
    - "Compliance verification throughout change process"
    - "Rollback capability for all modifications"
    - "Archaeological preservation of change history"

# Evolution Strategy Implementation
evolution_strategy:
  architectural_reformation_support:
    - "Support for systematic architectural reformation"
    - "Phase-based evolution with governance validation"
    - "Component elimination with archaeological preservation"
    - "Semantic mapping framework integration"
  
  future_evolution_preparation:
    - "Pure Logic language evolution support"
    - "Universal parser integration governance"
    - "Runtime architecture transformation management"
    - "YAML independence migration oversight"

# Elimination Management
elimination_governance:
  elimination_criteria:
    - "Lack of logical system interaction"
    - "No multi-dimensional correlational impact"
    - "Semantic inconsistency with architectural principles"
    - "Redundancy with existing components"
  
  elimination_process:
    - "Archaeological backup of eliminated components"
    - "Impact analysis for elimination consequences"
    - "Cross-reference cleanup and validation"
    - "System coherence verification post-elimination"

# Cross-Ruleset Integration
integration:
  dependent_rulesets:
    - "akao:ruleset:architecture:system:structural_governance:v1"
    - "akao:ruleset:architecture:quality:measurement_governance:v1"
  
  provides_foundation_for:
    - "Universal validation system evolution requirements"

  architectural_coherence:
    - "Enables consistent evolution governance across all architectural domains"
    - "Provides change foundation for architectural integrity"
    - "Supports systematic architectural transformation"

# Implementation Notes
implementation:
  migration_status: "migrated_from_rule_category"
  migration_date: "2025-07-08"
  semantic_validation: "verified_through_semantic_mapping_framework"
  architectural_alignment: "confirmed_with_governance_taxonomy"
  
  future_evolution:
    - "Integration with architectural reformation process"
    - "Enhanced change impact analysis automation"
    - "Evolution strategy optimization"

# Archaeological Preservation
archaeological_data:
  original_categorization: "rule_based_compliance"
  migration_rationale: "evolution_architecture_governance_alignment"
  semantic_mapping_validation: "completed"
  governance_taxonomy_verification: "passed"
  rule_governance_philosophy_integration: "verified"

# Special Note: Self-Validation Elimination
self_validation_elimination:
  rationale: "Self-validation concept creates logical inconsistency within validation framework"
  replacement: "Universal validation system that operates on any codebase including Akao itself"
  implementation: "Will be completed in Phase 1 Step 4 - Universal Validation Implementation"
  archaeological_preservation: "Self-validation rule archived in eliminated components"
