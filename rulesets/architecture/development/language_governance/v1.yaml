# Governance Framework
governance:
  enforcement_level: "mandatory"
  validation_scope: "universal"
  compliance_requirements:
    - "Each scope must use exactly one primary language"
    - "Language boundaries must be clearly defined and enforced"
    - "Language mixing must be minimized and justified"
    - "Pure Logic development must be supported and prepared"
  
  violation_handling:
    - "Language boundary violations require immediate resolution"
    - "Multiple primary languages in scope constitute governance violations"
    - "Unjustified language mixing impacts architectural integrity"
    - "Pure Logic development impediments require correction"
  
  quality_metrics:
    - "Language scope separation integrity >= 100%"
    - "Single primary language compliance >= 98%"
    - "Language boundary clarity >= 95%"
    - "Pure Logic development readiness >= 90%"

# Language Isolation Implementation

    configuration: "YAML for configuration until Pure Logic independence"
    documentation: "Markdown for human-readable documentation"
    build_system: "CMake/Make for build process management"
  
  isolation_principles:
    - "Language choice must be architecturally justified"
    - "Cross-language interfaces must be minimized"
    - "Language-specific features must not leak across boundaries"
    - "Translation between languages must be systematic"
