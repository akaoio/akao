# Universe Directory

This directory contains generated universes - the output of Akao's generation capabilities.

## Structure

- `projects/` - Generated projects of all types and languages
- `frameworks/` - Generated framework implementations
- `languages/` - Generated language support and adapters
- `platforms/` - Generated platform-specific implementations

## Philosophy Compliance

- `akao:philosophy:generation:universe:v1` - Generate complete universes of implementations
- `akao:philosophy:validation:universal:v1` - All generated content is universally validatable

## Usage

Universes are generated using the `akao generate` command family:
- `akao generate project --lang <language>`
- `akao generate framework --type <framework_type>`
- `akao generate language --name <language_name>`

## Note

This directory grows as universes are generated. Each generated universe
maintains its own validation and compliance standards.
