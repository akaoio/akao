description: |
  All system relationships must be visualizable through generated graphs, and every operation, 
  dependency, and relationship must be representable in visual form. Complex systems become 
  incomprehensible without visual representation of their structure and dependencies.

  domain: "visualization"
  predicate: "graph_explorable_visually_explainable"
  axioms:
    - "∀s ∈ SystemRelationships: visualizable(s) ∧ graph_representable(s)"
